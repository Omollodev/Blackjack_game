## This is Blackjack game tutorial for beginners. 

This is sample of python project for beginner. It's a guessing game user play with the computer.
The program generates a random number using the random function imported. The
user tries to guess it by inputting a value. The program then indicates
whether the guess is right or not. If it is wrong, then the program should
tell how off the guess was. If it is right, there should be another positive
indicator. You can place a limit on the number of guesses allowed.
You will also need functions to compare the inputted number with the
guessed number, to compute the difference between the two, and to check
whether an actual number was inputted or not.
